    When you are worried about your site SEO, you probably make many things to correct problems such as creating
    redirects, correcting broken URLs etc. But, it can take a long time to Google come back and see that you've
    done a good job.
    
    Fortunately, you yourself can mark desired URLs as corrected. But, if you have a large number of indexed URLs
    and make lots of simultaneous changes, it can be hard to keep track of those URLs.

    google-seo-analyzer helps you by crawling all problematic URLs and generating a report about which statuses
    have been changed and by ordering URLs in such a way you can easily identify error patterns.
